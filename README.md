How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
39 lines. The loop stops repeating +10 when the x < width-10

What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
First 10 is to draw a start point, second 10 is to set the stop point, and the third 10 is to set the length between every lines.
